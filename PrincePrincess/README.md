# Prince and Princess

## Problem Statement

> Long long ago there lived a beautiful and intelligent princess who was obsessed with mathematics. When the time came she decided to marry one of the two most intelli- gent and good - natured princes: A and B. The two princes were called to the court and were asked to stand in front of the princess.

> A natural number was written on the crown of each prince. No prince could see the number on his own crown but he could see the number written on the other crown. The princess wrote two distinct natural numbers on a board and announced that one of the board numbers is the sum of the numbers written on their crowns. The princess would ask prince A: "do you know the number written on your crown?" If A's answer was "no", the princess would ask prince B the same question. If B's answer was "no" , the princess would ask prince A the same question. This process would continue in the cyclic order A, B, A, B, ……. until a prince answers "yes". The prince who would correctly guess the number written on his crown would win the opportunity to marry the princess.

> The assumptions in the problem are: the two princes were equally intelligent and truthful, no other form of communication was allowed, and each prince was able to hear the answer of the other prince. What happened eventually? Did the princess get married? If no, how? If yes, to whom?

> The counterintuitive result is that the princess got married eventually to one of the two princes! How is this possible?
